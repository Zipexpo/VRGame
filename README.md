# CS 4331-002 - Virtual Reality Project 2

We plan on creating a game where the user needs to evacuate a city/town in an severe weather scenario. In this sense, we are developing a project that includes resource-management aspects, while also incorporating evacuation scenarios.
 
## Video Demo
Video demonstration will go here.

## Project Report

### Project Planning
The majority of our research and planning is located on our [Wiki](https://github.com/joyellealina/VRGame/wiki/VR-Evacuation-Game---Home) page.

### Tools/Devices Used
- Unity 2017
- Github Desktop
- Visual Studio, VSCode, etc. (Any editor is fine)
- Oculus Rift & Touch Controllers
- Unity Oculus SDK

### We learned...
- How to collaborate as a team on a larger project
- How to use more advanced Unity features
- Advanced C# scripting
- How to integrate VR controls

### Biggest issues

***Merge Conflicts***

Upon completing work on seperate branches, we ran into several issues when trying to merge everything into the master branch. Various scene aspects such as models, scripts and settings were not present. We were able to successfully merge one development branch into master by accepting all of the development branch changes since the master was a bare scene. To avoid future issues, we had to carefully commit and push our work, making sure to not work on the same thing or wait until something was completely done before moving onto the next feature.

***Use of Free Models and Aspects***

Due to time constraints and lack of experience, we were unable to produce any of our own 3D models for this project. This led to using free Unity aspects and models found online. The problem with this is limited functionality. We did our best to modify assets and models to best suit the use cases for this project. For the list of assets and models used, please navigate to our ***External Model Resources*** section.
